    "description": "The Baduanjin qigong is one of the most common forms of Chinese qigong used as exercise. Variously translated as Eight Pieces of Brocade, Eight-Section Brocade, Eight Silken Movements or Eight Silk Weaving, the form's name refers to how its eight movements characterize and impart a silken quality, like that of brocade, to the body and its energy. It is primarily designated as a form of medical qigong, meant to improve health."
